## Background

Eulr is a single-page blogging platform based off of Tumblr. Users can make text posts, share quotes and photos, upload videos, and much more. 

## Screenshots

## Technologies

* React/Redux frontend
* Ruby on Rails backend
* PostgreSQL database
* AWS S3 file hosting

## Code Highlights

* Editing a post causes the post itself to smoothly transition into the post editing form. This is achieved by wrapping each post in a container element, which conditionally renders either the post or the post edit form, depending on the redux store state.
